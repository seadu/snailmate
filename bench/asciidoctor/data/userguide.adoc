AsciiDoc is a text document format for writing notes, documentation,
articles, books, ebooks, slideshows, web pages, blogs and UNIX man
pages.  AsciiDoc files can be translated to many formats including
HTML, PDF, EPUB, man page.  AsciiDoc is highly configurable: both the
AsciiDoc source file syntax and the backend output markups (which can
be almost any type of SGML/XML markup) can be customized and extended
by the user.

.This document
**********************************************************************
This is an overly large document, it probably needs to be refactored
into a Tutorial, Quick Reference and Formal Reference.

If you're new to AsciiDoc read this section and the <<X6,Getting
Started>> section and take a look at the example AsciiDoc (`*.txt`)
source files in the distribution `doc` directory.
**********************************************************************


Introduction
------------
AsciiDoc is a plain text human readable/writable document format that
can be translated to DocBook or HTML using the asciidoc(1) command.
You can then either use asciidoc(1) generated HTML directly or run
asciidoc(1) DocBook output through your favorite DocBook toolchain or
use the AsciiDoc a2x(1) toolchain wrapper to produce PDF, EPUB, DVI,
LaTeX, PostScript, man page, HTML and text formats.

The AsciiDoc format is a useful presentation format in its own right:
AsciiDoc markup is simple, intuitive and as such is easily proofed and
edited.

AsciiDoc is light weight: it consists of a single Python script and a
bunch of configuration files. Apart from asciidoc(1) and a Python
interpreter, no other programs are required to convert AsciiDoc text
files to DocBook or HTML. See <<X11,Example AsciiDoc Documents>>
below.

Text markup conventions tend to be a matter of (often strong) personal
preference: if the default syntax is not to your liking you can define
your own by editing the text based asciidoc(1) configuration files.
You can also create configuration files to translate AsciiDoc
documents to almost any SGML/XML markup.

asciidoc(1) comes with a set of configuration files to translate
AsciiDoc articles, books and man pages to HTML or DocBook backend
formats.

.My AsciiDoc Itch
**********************************************************************
DocBook has emerged as the de facto standard Open Source documentation
format. But DocBook is a complex language, the markup is difficult to
read and even more difficult to write directly -- I found I was
spending more time typing markup tags, consulting reference manuals
and fixing syntax errors, than I was writing the documentation.

Getting Started
---------------
Installing AsciiDoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
See the `README` and `INSTALL` files for install prerequisites and
procedures. Packagers take a look at <<X38,Packager Notes>>.

[[X11]]
Example AsciiDoc Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The best way to quickly get a feel for AsciiDoc is to view the
AsciiDoc web site and/or distributed examples:

- Take a look at the linked examples on the AsciiDoc web site home
  page {website}.  Press the 'Page Source' sidebar menu item to view
  corresponding AsciiDoc source.
- Read the `*.txt` source files in the distribution `./doc` directory
  along with the corresponding HTML and DocBook XML files.


AsciiDoc Document Types
-----------------------
There are three types of AsciiDoc documents: article, book and
manpage. All document types share the same AsciiDoc format with some
minor variations. If you are familiar with DocBook you will have
noticed that AsciiDoc document types correspond to the same-named
DocBook document types.

Use the asciidoc(1) `-d` (`--doctype`) option to specify the AsciiDoc
document type -- the default document type is 'article'.

By convention the `.txt` file extension is used for AsciiDoc document
source files.

article
~~~~~~~
Used for short documents, articles and general documentation.  See the
AsciiDoc distribution `./doc/article.txt` example.

AsciiDoc defines standard DocBook article frontmatter and backmatter
<<X93,section markup templates>> (appendix, abstract, bibliography,
glossary, index).

book
~~~~
Books share the same format as articles, with the following
differences:

- The part titles in multi-part books are <<X17,top level titles>>
  (same level as book title).
- Some sections are book specific e.g. preface and colophon.

Book documents will normally be used to produce DocBook output since
DocBook processors can automatically generate footnotes, table of
contents, list of tables, list of figures, list of examples and
indexes.

AsciiDoc defines standard DocBook book frontmatter and backmatter
<<X93,section markup templates>> (appendix, dedication, preface,
bibliography, glossary, index, colophon).

.Example book documents
Book::
  The `./doc/book.txt` file in the AsciiDoc distribution.

Multi-part book::
  The `./doc/book-multi.txt` file in the AsciiDoc distribution.

manpage
~~~~~~~
Used to generate roff format UNIX manual pages.  AsciiDoc manpage
documents observe special header title and section naming conventions
-- see the <<X1,Manpage Documents>> section for details.

AsciiDoc defines the 'synopsis' <<X93,section markup template>> to
generate the DocBook `refsynopsisdiv` section.

See also the asciidoc(1) man page source (`./doc/asciidoc.1.txt`) from
the AsciiDoc distribution.


[[X5]]
AsciiDoc Backends
-----------------
The asciidoc(1) command translates an AsciiDoc formatted file to the
backend format specified by the `-b` (`--backend`) command-line
option. asciidoc(1) itself has little intrinsic knowledge of backend
formats, all translation rules are contained in customizable cascading
configuration files. Backend specific attributes are listed in the
<<X88,Backend Attributes>> section.

docbook45::
  Outputs DocBook XML 4.5 markup.

html4::
  This backend generates plain HTML 4.01 Transitional markup.

xhtml11::
  This backend generates XHTML 1.1 markup styled with CSS2. Output
  files have an `.html` extension.

html5::
  This backend generates HTML 5 markup, apart from the inclusion of
  <<X98,audio and video block macros>> it is functionally identical to
  the 'xhtml11' backend.

slidy::
  Use this backend to generate self-contained
  http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy2/[Slidy] HTML slideshows for
  your web browser from AsciiDoc documents. The Slidy backend is
  documented in the distribution `doc/slidy.txt` file and
  {website}slidy.html[online].

wordpress::
  A minor variant of the 'html4' backend to support
  http://srackham.wordpress.com/blogpost1/[blogpost].

latex::
  Experimental LaTeX backend.

Backend Aliases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Backend aliases are alternative names for AsciiDoc backends.  AsciiDoc
comes with two backend aliases: 'html' (aliased to 'xhtml11') and
'docbook' (aliased to 'docbook45').

You can assign (or reassign) backend aliases by setting an AsciiDoc
attribute named like `backend-alias-<alias>` to an AsciiDoc backend
name. For example, the following backend alias attribute definitions
appear in the `[attributes]` section of the global `asciidoc.conf`
configuration file:

  backend-alias-html=xhtml11
  backend-alias-docbook=docbook45

[[X100]]
Backend Plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The asciidoc(1) `--backend` option is also used to install and manage
backend <<X101,plugins>>.

- A backend plugin is used just like the built-in backends.
- Backend plugins <<X27,take precedence>> over built-in backends with
  the same name.
- You can use the `{asciidoc-confdir}` <<X60, intrinsic attribute>> to
  refer to the built-in backend configuration file location from
  backend plugin configuration files.
- You can use the `{backend-confdir}` <<X60, intrinsic attribute>> to
  refer to the backend plugin configuration file location.
- By default backends plugins are installed in
  `$HOME/.asciidoc/backends/<backend>` where `<backend>` is the
  backend name.


DocBook
-------
AsciiDoc generates 'article', 'book' and 'refentry'
http://www.docbook.org/[DocBook] documents (corresponding to the
AsciiDoc 'article', 'book' and 'manpage' document types).

Most Linux distributions come with conversion tools (collectively
called a toolchain) for <<X12,converting DocBook files>> to
presentation formats such as Postscript, HTML, PDF, EPUB, DVI,
PostScript, LaTeX, roff (the native man page format), HTMLHelp,
JavaHelp and text.  There are also programs that allow you to view
DocBook files directly, for example http://live.gnome.org/Yelp[Yelp]
(the GNOME help viewer).

[[X12]]
Converting DocBook to other file formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DocBook files are validated, parsed and translated various
presentation file formats using a combination of applications
collectively called a DocBook 'tool chain'. The function of a tool
chain is to read the DocBook markup (produced by AsciiDoc) and
transform it to a presentation format (for example HTML, PDF, HTML
Help, EPUB, DVI, PostScript, LaTeX).

A wide range of user output format requirements coupled with a choice
of available tools and stylesheets results in many valid tool chain
combinations.

[[X43]]
a2x Toolchain Wrapper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One of the biggest hurdles for new users is installing, configuring
and using a DocBook XML toolchain. `a2x(1)` can help -- it's a
toolchain wrapper command that will generate XHTML (chunked and
unchunked), PDF, EPUB, DVI, PS, LaTeX, man page, HTML Help and text
file outputs from an AsciiDoc text file.  `a2x(1)` does all the grunt
work associated with generating and sequencing the toolchain commands
and managing intermediate and output files.  `a2x(1)` also optionally
deploys admonition and navigation icons and a CSS stylesheet. See the
`a2x(1)` man page for more details. In addition to `asciidoc(1)` you
also need <<X40,xsltproc(1)>>, <<X13,DocBook XSL Stylesheets>> and
optionally: <<X31,dblatex>> or <<X14,FOP>> (to generate PDF);
`w3m(1)` or `lynx(1)` (to generate text).

The following examples generate `doc/source-highlight-filter.pdf` from
the AsciiDoc `doc/source-highlight-filter.txt` source file. The first
example uses `dblatex(1)` (the default PDF generator) the second
example forces FOP to be used:

  $ a2x -f pdf doc/source-highlight-filter.txt
  $ a2x -f pdf --fop doc/source-highlight-filter.txt

See the `a2x(1)` man page for details.

TIP: Use the `--verbose` command-line option to view executed
toolchain commands.

HTML generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AsciiDoc produces nicely styled HTML directly without requiring a
DocBook toolchain but there are also advantages in going the DocBook
route:

- HTML from DocBook can optionally include automatically generated
  indexes, tables of contents, footnotes, lists of figures and tables.
- DocBook toolchains can also (optionally) generate separate (chunked)
  linked HTML pages for each document section.
- Toolchain processing performs link and document validity checks.
- If the DocBook 'lang' attribute is set then things like table of
  contents, figure and table captions and admonition captions will be
  output in the specified language (setting the AsciiDoc 'lang'
  attribute sets the DocBook 'lang' attribute).

On the other hand, HTML output directly from AsciiDoc is much faster,
is easily customized and can be used in situations where there is no
suitable DocBook toolchain (for example, see the {website}[AsciiDoc
website]).

PDF generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are two commonly used tools to generate PDFs from DocBook,
<<X31,dblatex>> and <<X14,FOP>>.

.dblatex or FOP?
- 'dblatex' is easier to install, there's zero configuration
  required and no Java VM to install -- it just works out of the box.
- 'dblatex' source code highlighting and numbering is superb.
- 'dblatex' is easier to use as it converts DocBook directly to PDF
  whereas before using 'FOP' you have to convert DocBook to XML-FO
  using <<X13,DocBook XSL Stylesheets>>.
- 'FOP' is more feature complete (for example, callouts are processed
  inside literal layouts) and arguably produces nicer looking output.

HTML Help generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
. Convert DocBook XML documents to HTML Help compiler source files
  using <<X13,DocBook XSL Stylesheets>> and <<X40,xsltproc(1)>>.
. Convert the HTML Help source (`.hhp` and `.html`) files to HTML Help
  (`.chm`) files using the <<X67,Microsoft HTML Help Compiler>>.

Toolchain components summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AsciiDoc::
    Converts AsciiDoc (`.txt`) files to DocBook XML (`.xml`) files.

[[X13]]http://docbook.sourceforge.net/projects/xsl/[DocBook XSL Stylesheets]::
  These are a set of XSL stylesheets containing rules for converting
  DocBook XML documents to HTML, XSL-FO, manpage and HTML Help files.
  The stylesheets are used in conjunction with an XML parser such as
  <<X40,xsltproc(1)>>.

[[X40]]http://www.xmlsoft.org[xsltproc]::
  An XML parser for applying XSLT stylesheets (in our case the
  <<X13,DocBook XSL Stylesheets>>) to XML documents.

[[X31]]http://dblatex.sourceforge.net/[dblatex]::
  Generates PDF, DVI, PostScript and LaTeX formats directly from
  DocBook source via the intermediate LaTeX typesetting language --
  uses <<X13,DocBook XSL Stylesheets>>, <<X40,xsltproc(1)>> and
  `latex(1)`.

[[X14]]http://xml.apache.org/fop/[FOP]::
  The Apache Formatting Objects Processor converts XSL-FO (`.fo`)
  files to PDF files.  The XSL-FO files are generated from DocBook
  source files using <<X13,DocBook XSL Stylesheets>> and
  <<X40,xsltproc(1)>>.

[[X67]]Microsoft Help Compiler::
  The Microsoft HTML Help Compiler (`hhc.exe`) is a command-line tool
  that converts HTML Help source files to a single HTML Help (`.chm`)
  file. It runs on MS Windows platforms and can be downloaded from
  http://www.microsoft.com.

AsciiDoc dblatex configuration files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The AsciiDoc distribution `./dblatex` directory contains
`asciidoc-dblatex.xsl` (customized XSL parameter settings) and
`asciidoc-dblatex.sty` (customized LaTeX settings). These are examples
of optional <<X31,dblatex>> output customization and are used by
<<X43,a2x(1)>>.

AsciiDoc DocBook XSL Stylesheets drivers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You will have noticed that the distributed HTML and HTML Help
documentation files (for example `./doc/asciidoc.html`) are not the
plain outputs produced using the default 'DocBook XSL Stylesheets'
configuration.  This is because they have been processed using
customized DocBook XSL Stylesheets along with (in the case of HTML
outputs) the custom `./stylesheets/docbook-xsl.css` CSS stylesheet.

You'll find the customized DocBook XSL drivers along with additional
documentation in the distribution `./docbook-xsl` directory. The
examples that follow are executed from the distribution documentation
(`./doc`) directory. These drivers are also used by <<X43,a2x(1)>>.

`common.xsl`::
    Shared driver parameters.  This file is not used directly but is
    included in all the following drivers.

`chunked.xsl`::
    Generate chunked XHTML (separate HTML pages for each document
    section) in the `./doc/chunked` directory. For example:

    $ python ../asciidoc.py -b docbook asciidoc.txt
    $ xsltproc --nonet ../docbook-xsl/chunked.xsl asciidoc.xml

`epub.xsl`::
    Used by <<X43,a2x(1)>> to generate EPUB formatted documents.

`fo.xsl`::
    Generate XSL Formatting Object (`.fo`) files for subsequent PDF
    file generation using FOP. For example:

    $ python ../asciidoc.py -b docbook article.txt
    $ xsltproc --nonet ../docbook-xsl/fo.xsl article.xml > article.fo
    $ fop article.fo article.pdf

`htmlhelp.xsl`::
    Generate Microsoft HTML Help source files for the MS HTML Help
    Compiler in the `./doc/htmlhelp` directory. This example is run on
    MS Windows from a Cygwin shell prompt:

    $ python ../asciidoc.py -b docbook asciidoc.txt
    $ xsltproc --nonet ../docbook-xsl/htmlhelp.xsl asciidoc.xml
    $ c:/Program\ Files/HTML\ Help\ Workshop/hhc.exe htmlhelp.hhp

`manpage.xsl`::
    Generate a `roff(1)` format UNIX man page from a DocBook XML
    'refentry' document. This example generates an `asciidoc.1` man
    page file:

    $ python ../asciidoc.py -d manpage -b docbook asciidoc.1.txt
    $ xsltproc --nonet ../docbook-xsl/manpage.xsl asciidoc.1.xml

`xhtml.xsl`::
    Convert a DocBook XML file to a single XHTML file. For example:

    $ python ../asciidoc.py -b docbook asciidoc.txt
    $ xsltproc --nonet ../docbook-xsl/xhtml.xsl asciidoc.xml > asciidoc.html

If you want to see how the complete documentation set is processed
take a look at the A-A-P script `./doc/main.aap`.


Generating Plain Text Files
---------------------------
AsciiDoc does not have a text backend (for most purposes AsciiDoc
source text is fine), however you can convert AsciiDoc text files to
formatted text using the AsciiDoc <<X43,a2x(1)>> toolchain wrapper
utility.


[[X35]]
HTML5 and XHTML 1.1
-------------------
The 'xhtml11' and 'html5' backends embed or link CSS and JavaScript
files in their outputs, there is also a <<X99,themes>> plugin
framework.

- If the AsciiDoc 'linkcss' attribute is defined then CSS and
  JavaScript files are linked to the output document, otherwise they
  are embedded (the default behavior).
- The default locations for CSS and JavaScript files can be changed by
  setting the AsciiDoc 'stylesdir' and 'scriptsdir' attributes
  respectively.
- The default locations for embedded and linked files differ and are
  calculated at different times -- embedded files are loaded when
  asciidoc(1) generates the output document, linked files are loaded
  by the browser when the user views the output document.
- Embedded files are automatically inserted in the output files but
  you need to manually copy linked CSS and Javascript files from
  AsciiDoc <<X27,configuration directories>> to the correct location
  relative to the output document.

.Stylesheet file locations
[cols="3*",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|====================================================================
|'stylesdir' attribute
|Linked location ('linkcss' attribute defined)
|Embedded location ('linkcss' attribute undefined)

|Undefined (default).
|Same directory as the output document.
|`stylesheets` subdirectory in the AsciiDoc configuration directory
(the directory containing the backend conf file).

|Absolute or relative directory name.
|Absolute or relative to the output document.
|Absolute or relative to the AsciiDoc configuration directory (the
directory containing the backend conf file).

|====================================================================

.JavaScript file locations
[cols="3*",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|====================================================================
|'scriptsdir' attribute
|Linked location ('linkcss' attribute defined)
|Embedded location ('linkcss' attribute undefined)

|Undefined (default).
|Same directory as the output document.
|`javascripts` subdirectory in the AsciiDoc configuration directory
(the directory containing the backend conf file).

|Absolute or relative directory name.
|Absolute or relative to the output document.
|Absolute or relative to the AsciiDoc configuration directory (the
directory containing the backend conf file).

|====================================================================

[[X99]]
Themes
~~~~~~
The AsciiDoc 'theme' attribute is used to select an alternative CSS
stylesheet and to optionally include additional JavaScript code.

- Theme files reside in an AsciiDoc <<X27,configuration directory>>
  named `themes/<theme>/` (where `<theme>` is the the theme name set
  by the 'theme' attribute). asciidoc(1) sets the 'themedir' attribute
  to the theme directory path name.
- The 'theme' attribute can also be set using the asciidoc(1)
  `--theme` option, the `--theme` option can also be used to manage
  theme <<X101,plugins>>.
- AsciiDoc ships with two themes: 'flask' and 'volnitsky'.
- The `<theme>.css` file replaces the default `asciidoc.css` CSS file.
- The `<theme>.js` file is included in addition to the default
  `asciidoc.js` JavaScript file.
- If the <<X66,data-uri>> attribute is defined then icons are loaded
  from the theme `icons` sub-directory if it exists (i.e.  the
  'iconsdir' attribute is set to theme `icons` sub-directory path).
- Embedded theme files are automatically inserted in the output files
  but you need to manually copy linked CSS and Javascript files to the
  location of the output documents.
- Linked CSS and JavaScript theme files are linked to the same linked
  locations as <<X35,other CSS and JavaScript files>>.

For example, the command-line option `--theme foo` (or `--attribute
theme=foo`) will cause asciidoc(1) to search <<X27,configuration
file locations 1, 2 and 3>> for a sub-directory called `themes/foo`
containing the stylesheet `foo.css` and optionally a JavaScript file
name `foo.js`.


Document Structure
------------------
An AsciiDoc document consists of a series of <<X8,block elements>>
starting with an optional document Header, followed by an optional
Preamble, followed by zero or more document Sections.

Almost any combination of zero or more elements constitutes a valid
AsciiDoc document: documents can range from a single sentence to a
multi-part book.

Block Elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Block elements consist of one or more lines of text and may contain
other block elements.

The AsciiDoc block structure can be informally summarized as follows
footnote:[This is a rough structural guide, not a rigorous syntax
definition]:

  Document      ::= (Header?,Preamble?,Section*)
  Header        ::= (Title,(AuthorInfo,RevisionInfo?)?)
  AuthorInfo    ::= (FirstName,(MiddleName?,LastName)?,EmailAddress?)
  RevisionInfo  ::= (RevisionNumber?,RevisionDate,RevisionRemark?)
  Preamble      ::= (SectionBody)
  Section       ::= (Title,SectionBody?,(Section)*)
  SectionBody   ::= ((BlockTitle?,Block)|BlockMacro)+
  Block         ::= (Paragraph|DelimitedBlock|List|Table)
  List          ::= (BulletedList|NumberedList|LabeledList|CalloutList)
  BulletedList  ::= (ListItem)+
  NumberedList  ::= (ListItem)+
  CalloutList   ::= (ListItem)+
  LabeledList   ::= (ListEntry)+
  ListEntry     ::= (ListLabel,ListItem)
  ListLabel     ::= (ListTerm+)
  ListItem      ::= (ItemText,(List|ListParagraph|ListContinuation)*)

Where:

- '?' implies zero or one occurrence, '+' implies one or more
  occurrences, '*' implies zero or more occurrences.
- All block elements are separated by line boundaries.
- `BlockId`, `AttributeEntry` and `AttributeList` block elements (not
  shown) can occur almost anywhere.
- There are a number of document type and backend specific
  restrictions imposed on the block syntax.
- The following elements cannot contain blank lines: Header, Title,
  Paragraph, ItemText.
- A ListParagraph is a Paragraph with its 'listelement' option set.
- A ListContinuation is a <<X15,list continuation element>>.

[[X95]]
Header
~~~~~~
The Header contains document meta-data, typically title plus optional
authorship and revision information:

- The Header is optional, but if it is used it must start with a
  document <<X17,title>>.
- Optional Author and Revision information immediately follows the
  header title.
- The document header must be separated from the remainder of the
  document by one or more blank lines and cannot contain blank lines.
- The header can include comments.
- The header can include <<X18,attribute entries>>, typically
  'doctype', 'lang', 'encoding', 'icons', 'data-uri', 'toc',
  'numbered'.
- Header attributes are overridden by command-line attributes.
- If the header contains non-UTF-8 characters then the 'encoding' must
  precede the header (either in the document or on the command-line).

Here's an example AsciiDoc document header:

  Writing Documentation using AsciiDoc
  ====================================
  Joe Bloggs <jbloggs@mymail.com>
  v2.0, February 2003:
  Rewritten for version 2 release.

The author information line contains the author's name optionally
followed by the author's email address. The author's name is formatted
like:

  firstname[ [middlename ]lastname][ <email>]]

i.e. a first name followed by optional middle and last names followed
by an email address in that order.  Multi-word first, middle and last
names can be entered using the underscore as a word separator.  The
email address comes last and must be enclosed in angle <> brackets.
Here a some examples of author information lines:

  Joe Bloggs <jbloggs@mymail.com>
  Joe Bloggs
  Vincent Willem van_Gogh

If the author line does not match the above specification then the
entire author line is treated as the first name.

The optional revision information line follows the author information
line. The revision information can be one of two formats:

. An optional document revision number followed by an optional
  revision date followed by an optional revision remark:
+
--
  * If the revision number is specified it must be followed by a
    comma.
  * The revision number must contain at least one numeric character.
  * Any non-numeric characters preceding the first numeric character
    will be dropped.
  * If a revision remark is specified it must be preceded by a colon.
    The revision remark extends from the colon up to the next blank
    line, attribute entry or comment and is subject to normal text
    substitutions.
  * If a revision number or remark has been set but the revision date
    has not been set then the revision date is set to the value of the
    'docdate' attribute.

Examples:

  v2.0, February 2003
  February 2003
  v2.0,
  v2.0, February 2003: Rewritten for version 2 release.
  February 2003: Rewritten for version 2 release.
  v2.0,: Rewritten for version 2 release.
  :Rewritten for version 2 release.
--

. The revision information line can also be an RCS/CVS/SVN $Id$
  marker:
+
--
  * AsciiDoc extracts the 'revnumber', 'revdate', and 'author'
    attributes from the $Id$ revision marker and displays them in the
    document header.
  * If an $Id$ revision marker is used the header author line can be
    omitted.

Example:

  $Id: mydoc.txt,v 1.5 2009/05/17 17:58:44 jbloggs Exp $
--

You can override or set header parameters by passing 'revnumber',
'revremark', 'revdate', 'email', 'author', 'authorinitials',
'firstname' and 'lastname' attributes using the asciidoc(1) `-a`
(`--attribute`) command-line option. For example:

  $ asciidoc -a revdate=2004/07/27 article.txt

Attribute entries can also be added to the header for substitution in
the header template with <<X18,Attribute Entry>> elements.

The 'title' element in HTML outputs is set to the AsciiDoc document
title, you can set it to a different value by including a 'title'
attribute entry in the document header.

[[X87]]
Additional document header information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AsciiDoc has two mechanisms for optionally including additional
meta-data in the header of the output document:

'docinfo' configuration file sections::
If a <<X7,configuration file>> section named 'docinfo' has been loaded
then it will be included in the document header. Typically the
'docinfo' section name will be prefixed with a '+' character so that it
is appended to (rather than replace) other 'docinfo' sections.

'docinfo' files::
Two docinfo files are recognized: one named `docinfo` and a second
named like the AsciiDoc source file with a `-docinfo` suffix.  For
example, if the source document is called `mydoc.txt` then the
document information files would be `docinfo.xml` and
`mydoc-docinfo.xml` (for DocBook outputs) and `docinfo.html` and
`mydoc-docinfo.html` (for HTML outputs).  The <<X97,docinfo, docinfo1
and docinfo2>> attributes control which docinfo files are included in
the output files.

The contents docinfo templates and files is dependent on the type of
output:

HTML::
  Valid 'head' child elements. Typically 'style' and 'script' elements
  for CSS and JavaScript inclusion.

DocBook::
  Valid 'articleinfo' or 'bookinfo' child elements.  DocBook defines
  numerous elements for document meta-data, for example: copyrights,
  document history and authorship information.  See the DocBook
  `./doc/article-docinfo.xml` example that comes with the AsciiDoc
  distribution.  The rendering of meta-data elements (or not) is
  DocBook processor dependent.


[[X86]]
Preamble
~~~~~~~~
The Preamble is an optional untitled section body between the document
Header and the first Section title.

Sections

In addition to the document title (level 0), AsciiDoc supports four
section levels: 1 (top) to 4 (bottom).  Section levels are delimited
by section <<X17,titles>>.  Sections are translated using
configuration file <<X93,section markup templates>>. AsciiDoc
generates the following <<X60,intrinsic attributes>> specifically for
use in section markup templates:

level::
The `level` attribute is the section level number, it is normally just
the <<X17,title>> level number (1..4). However, if the `leveloffset`
attribute is defined it will be added to the `level` attribute. The
`leveloffset` attribute is useful for <<X90,combining documents>>.

sectnum::
The `-n` (`--section-numbers`) command-line option generates the
`sectnum` (section number) attribute.  The `sectnum` attribute is used
for section numbers in HTML outputs (DocBook section numbering are
handled automatically by the DocBook toolchain commands).

[[X93]]
Section markup templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Section markup templates specify output markup and are defined in
AsciiDoc configuration files.  Section markup template names are
derived as follows (in order of precedence):

1. From the title's first positional attribute or 'template'
   attribute. For example, the following three section titles are
   functionally equivalent:
+
.....................................................................
[[terms]]
[glossary]
List of Terms
-------------

["glossary",id="terms"]
List of Terms
-------------

[template="glossary",id="terms"]
List of Terms
-------------
.....................................................................

2. When the title text matches a configuration file
   <<X16,`[specialsections]`>> entry.
3. If neither of the above the default `sect<level>` template is used
   (where `<level>` is a number from 1 to 4).

In addition to the normal section template names ('sect1', 'sect2',
'sect3', 'sect4') AsciiDoc has the following templates for
frontmatter, backmatter and other special sections: 'abstract',
'preface', 'colophon', 'dedication', 'glossary', 'bibliography',
'synopsis', 'appendix', 'index'.  These special section templates
generate the corresponding Docbook elements; for HTML outputs they
default to the 'sect1' section template.

Section IDs
^^^^^^^^^^^
If no explicit section ID is specified an ID will be synthesised from
the section title.  The primary purpose of this feature is to ensure
persistence of table of contents links (permalinks): the missing
section IDs are generated dynamically by the JavaScript TOC generator
*after* the page is loaded. If you link to a dynamically generated TOC
address the page will load but the browser will ignore the (as yet
ungenerated) section ID.

The IDs are generated by the following algorithm:

- Replace all non-alphanumeric title characters with underscores.
- Strip leading or trailing underscores.
- Convert to lowercase.
- Prepend the `idprefix` attribute (so there's no possibility of name
  clashes with existing document IDs). Prepend an underscore if the
  `idprefix` attribute is not defined.
- A numbered suffix (`_2`, `_3` ...) is added if a same named
  auto-generated section ID exists.
- If the `ascii-ids` attribute is defined then non-ASCII characters
  are replaced with ASCII equivalents. This attribute may be
  deprecated in future releases and *should be avoided*, it's sole
  purpose is to accommodate deficient downstream applications that
  cannot process non-ASCII ID attributes.

Example: the title 'Jim's House' would generate the ID `_jim_s_house`.

Section ID synthesis can be disabled by undefining the `sectids`
attribute.

[[X16]]
Special Section Titles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AsciiDoc has a mechanism for mapping predefined section titles
auto-magically to specific markup templates. For example a title
'Appendix A: Code Reference' will automatically use the 'appendix'
<<X93,section markup template>>. The mappings from title to template
name are specified in `[specialsections]` sections in the Asciidoc
language configuration files (`lang-*.conf`).  Section entries are
formatted like:

  <title>=<template>

`<title>` is a Python regular expression and `<template>` is the name
of a configuration file markup template section. If the `<title>`
matches an AsciiDoc document section title then the backend output is
marked up using the `<template>` markup template (instead of the
default `sect<level>` section template). The `{title}` attribute value
is set to the value of the matched regular expression group named
'title', if there is no 'title' group `{title}` defaults to the whole
of the AsciiDoc section title. If `<template>` is blank then any
existing entry with the same `<title>` will be deleted.

.Special section titles vs. explicit template names
*********************************************************************
AsciiDoc has two mechanisms for specifying non-default section markup
templates: you can specify the template name explicitly (using the
'template' attribute) or indirectly (using 'special section titles').
Specifying a <<X93,section template>> attribute explicitly is
preferred.  Auto-magical 'special section titles' have the following
drawbacks:

- They are non-obvious, you have to know the exact matching
  title for each special section on a language by language basis.
- Section titles are predefined and can only be customised with a
  configuration change.
- The implementation is complicated by multiple languages: every
  special section title has to be defined for each language (in each
  of the `lang-*.conf` files).

Specifying special section template names explicitly does add more
noise to the source document (the 'template' attribute declaration),
but the intention is obvious and the syntax is consistent with other
AsciiDoc elements c.f.  bibliographic, Q&A and glossary lists.

Special section titles have been deprecated but are retained for
backward compatibility.

*********************************************************************

Inline Elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<<X34,Inline document elements>> are used to format text and to
perform various types of text substitution. Inline elements and inline
element syntax is defined in the asciidoc(1) configuration files.

Here is a list of AsciiDoc inline elements in the (default) order in
which they are processed:

Special characters::
        These character sequences escape special characters used by
        the backend markup (typically `<`, `>`, and `&` characters).
        See `[specialcharacters]` configuration file sections.

Quotes::
        Elements that markup words and phrases; usually for character
        formatting. See `[quotes]` configuration file sections.

Special Words::
        Word or word phrase patterns singled out for markup without
        the need for further annotation.  See `[specialwords]`
        configuration file sections.

Replacements::
        Each replacement defines a word or word phrase pattern to
        search for along with corresponding replacement text. See
        `[replacements]` configuration file sections.

Attribute references::
        Document attribute names enclosed in braces are replaced by
        the corresponding attribute value.

Inline Macros::
        Inline macros are replaced by the contents of parametrized
        configuration file sections.


Document Processing
-------------------
The AsciiDoc source document is read and processed as follows:

1. The document 'Header' is parsed, header parameter values are
   substituted into the configuration file `[header]` template section
   which is then written to the output file.
2. Each document 'Section' is processed and its constituent elements
   translated to the output file.
3. The configuration file `[footer]` template section is substituted
   and written to the output file.

When a block element is encountered asciidoc(1) determines the type of
block by checking in the following order (first to last): (section)
Titles, BlockMacros, Lists, DelimitedBlocks, Tables, AttributeEntrys,
AttributeLists, BlockTitles, Paragraphs.

The default paragraph definition `[paradef-default]` is last element
to be checked.

Knowing the parsing order will help you devise unambiguous macro, list
and block syntax rules.

Inline substitutions within block elements are performed in the
following default order:

1. Special characters
2. Quotes
3. Special words
4. Replacements
5. Attributes
6. Inline Macros
7. Replacements2

The substitutions and substitution order performed on
Title, Paragraph and DelimitedBlock elements is determined by
configuration file parameters.


Text Formatting
---------------
[[X51]]
Quoted Text
~~~~~~~~~~~
Words and phrases can be formatted by enclosing inline text with
quote characters:

_Emphasized text_::
        Word phrases \'enclosed in single quote characters' (acute
        accents) or \_underline characters_ are emphasized.

*Strong text*::
        Word phrases \*enclosed in asterisk characters* are rendered
        in a strong font (usually bold).

[[X81]]+Monospaced text+::
        Word phrases \+enclosed in plus characters+ are rendered in a
        monospaced font. Word phrases \`enclosed in backtick
        characters` (grave accents) are also rendered in a monospaced
        font but in this case the enclosed text is rendered literally
        and is not subject to further expansion (see <<X80,inline
        literal passthrough>>).

`Single quoted text'::
        Phrases enclosed with a \`single grave accent to the left and
        a single acute accent to the right' are rendered in single
        quotation marks.

``Double quoted text''::
        Phrases enclosed with \\``two grave accents to the left and
        two acute accents to the right'' are rendered in quotation
        marks.

#Unquoted text#::
        Placing \#hashes around text# does nothing, it is a mechanism
        to allow inline attributes to be applied to otherwise
        unformatted text.

New quote types can be defined by editing asciidoc(1) configuration
files. See the <<X7,Configuration Files>> section for details.

.Quoted text behavior
- Quoting cannot be overlapped.
- Different quoting types can be nested.
- To suppress quoted text formatting place a backslash character
  immediately in front of the leading quote character(s). In the case
  of ambiguity between escaped and non-escaped text you will need to
  escape both leading and trailing quotes, in the case of
  multi-character quotes you may even need to escape individual
  characters.

[[X96]]
Quoted text attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Quoted text can be prefixed with an <<X21,attribute list>>.  The first
positional attribute ('role' attribute) is translated by AsciiDoc to
an HTML 'span' element 'class' attribute or a DocBook 'phrase' element
'role' attribute.

DocBook XSL Stylesheets translate DocBook 'phrase' elements with
'role' attributes to corresponding HTML 'span' elements with the same
'class' attributes; CSS can then be used
http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/UsingCSS.html[to style the
generated HTML].  Thus CSS styling can be applied to both DocBook and
AsciiDoc generated HTML outputs.  You can also specify multiple class
names separated by spaces.

CSS rules for text color, text background color, text size and text
decorators are included in the distributed AsciiDoc CSS files and are
used in conjunction with AsciiDoc 'xhtml11', 'html5' and 'docbook'
outputs. The CSS class names are:

- '<color>' (text foreground color).
- '<color>-background' (text background color).
- 'big' and 'small' (text size).
- 'underline', 'overline' and 'line-through' (strike through) text
  decorators.

Where '<color>' can be any of the
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#HTML_color_names[sixteen HTML
color names].  Examples:

  [red]#Obvious# and [big red yellow-background]*very obvious*.

  [underline]#Underline text#, [overline]#overline text# and
  [blue line-through]*bold blue and line-through*.

is rendered as:

[red]#Obvious# and [big red yellow-background]*very obvious*.

[underline]#Underline text#, [overline]#overline text# and
[bold blue line-through]*bold blue and line-through*.

NOTE: Color and text decorator attributes are rendered for XHTML and
HTML 5 outputs using CSS stylesheets.  The mechanism to implement
color and text decorator attributes is provided for DocBook toolchains
via the DocBook 'phrase' element 'role' attribute, but the actual
rendering is toolchain specific and is not part of the AsciiDoc
distribution.

[[X52]]
Constrained and Unconstrained Quotes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are actually two types of quotes:

Constrained quotes
++++++++++++++++++
Quoted must be bounded by white space or commonly adjoining
punctuation characters. These are the most commonly used type of
quote.

Unconstrained quotes
++++++++++++++++++++
Unconstrained quotes have no boundary constraints and can be placed
anywhere within inline text. For consistency and to make them easier
to remember unconstrained quotes are double-ups of the `_`, `*`, `+`
and `#` constrained quotes:

  __unconstrained emphasized text__
  **unconstrained strong text**
  ++unconstrained monospaced text++
  ##unconstrained unquoted text##

The following example emboldens the letter F:

  **F**ile Open...

Superscripts and Subscripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Put \^carets on either^ side of the text to be superscripted, put
\~tildes on either side~ of text to be subscripted.  For example, the
following line:

  e^&#960;i^+1 = 0. H~2~O and x^10^. Some ^super text^
  and ~some sub text~

Is rendered like:

e^&#960;i^+1 = 0. H~2~O and x^10^. Some ^super text^
and ~some sub text~

Superscripts and subscripts are implemented as <<X52,unconstrained
quotes>> and they can be escaped with a leading backslash and prefixed
with with an attribute list.

Line Breaks
~~~~~~~~~~~
A plus character preceded by at least one space character at the end
of a non-blank line forces a line break. It generates a line break
(`br`) tag for HTML outputs and a custom XML `asciidoc-br` processing
instruction for DocBook outputs. The `asciidoc-br` processing
instruction is handled by <<X43,a2x(1)>>.

Page Breaks
~~~~~~~~~~~
A line of three or more less-than (`<<<`) characters will generate a
hard page break in DocBook and printed HTML outputs.  It uses the CSS
`page-break-after` property for HTML outputs and a custom XML
`asciidoc-pagebreak` processing instruction for DocBook outputs. The
`asciidoc-pagebreak` processing instruction is handled by
<<X43,a2x(1)>>. Hard page breaks are sometimes handy but as a general
rule you should let your page processor generate page breaks for you.

Rulers
~~~~~~
A line of three or more apostrophe characters will generate a ruler
line.  It generates a ruler (`hr`) tag for HTML outputs and a custom
XML `asciidoc-hr` processing instruction for DocBook outputs. The
`asciidoc-hr` processing instruction is handled by <<X43,a2x(1)>>.

Tabs
~~~~
By default tab characters input files will translated to 8 spaces. Tab
expansion is set with the 'tabsize' entry in the configuration file
`[miscellaneous]` section and can be overridden in included files by
setting a 'tabsize' attribute in the `include` macro's attribute list.
For example:

  include::addendum.txt[tabsize=2]

The tab size can also be set using the attribute command-line option,
for example `--attribute tabsize=4`

Replacements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following replacements are defined in the default AsciiDoc
configuration:

  (C) copyright, (TM) trademark, (R) registered trademark,
  -- em dash, ... ellipsis, -> right arrow, <- left arrow, => right
  double arrow, <= left double arrow.

Which are rendered as:

(C) copyright, (TM) trademark, (R) registered trademark,
-- em dash, ... ellipsis, -> right arrow, <- left arrow, => right
double arrow, <= left double arrow.

You can also include arbitrary entity references in the AsciiDoc
source. Examples:

  &#x278a; &#182;

renders:

&#x278a; &#182;

To render a replacement literally escape it with a leading back-slash.

The <<X7,Configuration Files>> section explains how to configure your
own replacements.

Special Words
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Words defined in `[specialwords]` configuration file sections are
automatically marked up without having to be explicitly notated.

The <<X7,Configuration Files>> section explains how to add and replace
special words.


[[X17]]
Titles
------
Document and section titles can be in either of two formats:

Two line titles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A two line title consists of a title line, starting hard against the
left margin, and an underline. Section underlines consist a repeated
character pairs spanning the width of the preceding title (give or
take up to two characters):

The default title underlines for each of the document levels are:


  Level 0 (top level):     ======================
  Level 1:                 ----------------------
  Level 2:                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Level 3:                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  Level 4 (bottom level):  ++++++++++++++++++++++

Examples:

  Level One Section Title
  -----------------------

  Level 2 Subsection Title
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[X46]]
One line titles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One line titles consist of a single line delimited on either side by
one or more equals characters (the number of equals characters
corresponds to the section level minus one).  Here are some examples:

  = Document Title (level 0) =
  == Section title (level 1) ==
  === Section title (level 2) ===
  ==== Section title (level 3) ====
  ===== Section title (level 4) =====

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
- One or more spaces must fall between the title and the delimiters.
- The trailing title delimiter is optional.
- The one-line title syntax can be changed by editing the
  configuration file `[titles]` section `sect0`...`sect4` entries.
=====================================================================

Floating titles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Setting the title's first positional attribute or 'style' attribute to
'float' generates a free-floating title. A free-floating title is
rendered just like a normal section title but is not formally
associated with a text body and is not part of the regular section
hierarchy so the normal ordering rules do not apply. Floating titles
can also be used in contexts where section titles are illegal: for
example sidebar and admonition blocks.  Example:

  [float]
  The second day
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Floating titles do not appear in a document's table of contents.


[[X42]]
Block Titles
------------
A 'BlockTitle' element is a single line beginning with a period
followed by the title text. A BlockTitle is applied to the immediately
following Paragraph, DelimitedBlock, List, Table or BlockMacro. For
example:

........................
.Notes
- Note 1.
- Note 2.
........................

is rendered as:

.Notes
- Note 1.
- Note 2.


[[X41]]
BlockId Element
---------------
A 'BlockId' is a single line block element containing a unique
identifier enclosed in double square brackets. It is used to assign an
identifier to the ensuing block element. For example:

  [[chapter-titles]]
  Chapter titles can be ...

The preceding example identifies the ensuing paragraph so it can be
referenced from other locations, for example with
`<<chapter-titles,chapter titles>>`.

'BlockId' elements can be applied to Title, Paragraph, List,
DelimitedBlock, Table and BlockMacro elements.  The BlockId element
sets the `{id}` attribute for substitution in the subsequent block's
markup template. If a second positional argument is supplied it sets
the `{reftext}` attribute which is used to set the DocBook `xreflabel`
attribute.

The 'BlockId' element has the same syntax and serves the same function
to the <<X30,anchor inline macro>>.

[[X79]]
AttributeList Element
---------------------
An 'AttributeList' block element is an <<X21,attribute list>> on a
line by itself:

- 'AttributeList' attributes are only applied to the immediately
  following block element -- the attributes are made available to the
  block's markup template.
- Multiple contiguous 'AttributeList' elements are additively combined
  in the order they appear.
- The first positional attribute in the list is often used to specify
  the ensuing element's <<X23,style>>.

Attribute value substitution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By default, only substitutions that take place inside attribute list
values are attribute references, this is because not all attributes
are destined to be marked up and rendered as text (for example the
table 'cols' attribute). To perform normal inline text substitutions
(special characters, quotes, macros, replacements) on an attribute
value you need to enclose it in single quotes. In the following quote
block the second attribute value in the AttributeList is quoted to
ensure the 'http' macro is expanded to a hyperlink.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
[quote,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Johnson[Samuel Johnson]']
_____________________________________________________________________
Sir, a woman's preaching is like a dog's walking on his hind legs. It
is not done well; but you are surprised to find it done at all.
_____________________________________________________________________
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Common attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Most block elements support the following attributes:

[cols="1e,1,5a",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|====================================================================
|Name |Backends |Description

|id |html4, html5, xhtml11, docbook |
Unique identifier typically serve as link targets.
Can also be set by the 'BlockId' element.

|role |html4, html5, xhtml11, docbook |
Role contains a string used to classify or subclassify an element and
can be applied to AsciiDoc block elements.  The AsciiDoc 'role'
attribute is translated to the 'role' attribute in DocBook outputs and
is included in the 'class' attribute in HTML outputs, in this respect
it behaves like the <<X96,quoted text role attribute>>.

DocBook XSL Stylesheets translate DocBook 'role' attributes to HTML
'class' attributes; CSS can then be used
http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/UsingCSS.html[to style the
generated HTML].

|reftext |docbook |
'reftext' is used to set the DocBook 'xreflabel' attribute.
The 'reftext' attribute can an also be set by the 'BlockId' element.

|====================================================================


Paragraphs
----------
Paragraphs are blocks of text terminated by a blank line, the end of
file, or the start of a delimited block or a list.  There are three
paragraph syntaxes: normal, indented (literal) and admonition which
are rendered, by default, with the corresponding paragraph style.

Each syntax has a default style, but you can explicitly apply any
paragraph style to any paragraph syntax. You can also apply
<<X104,delimited block>> styles to single paragraphs.

The built-in paragraph styles are: 'normal', 'literal', 'verse',
'quote', 'listing', 'TIP', 'NOTE', 'IMPORTANT', 'WARNING', 'CAUTION',
'abstract', 'partintro', 'comment', 'example', 'sidebar', 'source',
'music', 'latex', 'graphviz'.

normal paragraph syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Normal paragraph syntax consists of one or more non-blank lines of
text. The first line must start hard against the left margin (no
intervening white space). The default processing expectation is that
of a normal paragraph of text.

[[X85]]
literal paragraph syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Literal paragraphs are rendered verbatim in a monospaced font without
any distinguishing background or border.  By default there is no text
formatting or substitutions within Literal paragraphs apart from
Special Characters and Callouts.

The 'literal' style is applied implicitly to indented paragraphs i.e.
where the first line of the paragraph is indented by one or more space
or tab characters.  For example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Consul *necessitatibus* per id,
  consetetur, eu pro everti postulant
  homero verear ea mea, qui.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Renders:

  Consul *necessitatibus* per id,
  consetetur, eu pro everti postulant
  homero verear ea mea, qui.

NOTE: Because <<X64,lists>> can be indented it's possible for your
indented paragraph to be misinterpreted as a list -- in situations
like this apply the 'literal' style to a normal paragraph.

Instead of using a paragraph indent you could apply the 'literal'
style explicitly, for example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
[literal]
Consul *necessitatibus* per id,
consetetur, eu pro everti postulant
homero verear ea mea, qui.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Renders:

[literal]
Consul *necessitatibus* per id,
consetetur, eu pro everti postulant
homero verear ea mea, qui.

[[X94]]
quote and verse paragraph styles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The optional 'attribution' and 'citetitle' attributes (positional
attributes 2 and 3) specify the author and source respectively.

The 'verse' style retains the line breaks, for example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
[verse, William Blake, from Auguries of Innocence]
To see a world in a grain of sand,
And a heaven in a wild flower,
Hold infinity in the palm of your hand,
And eternity in an hour.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Which is rendered as:

[verse, William Blake, from Auguries of Innocence]
To see a world in a grain of sand,
And a heaven in a wild flower,
Hold infinity in the palm of your hand,
And eternity in an hour.

The 'quote' style flows the text at left and right margins, for
example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
[quote, Bertrand Russell, The World of Mathematics (1956)]
A good notation has subtlety and suggestiveness which at times makes
it almost seem like a live teacher.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Which is rendered as:

[quote, Bertrand Russell, The World of Mathematics (1956)]
A good notation has subtlety and suggestiveness which at times makes
it almost seem like a live teacher.

[[X28]]
Admonition Paragraphs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
'TIP', 'NOTE', 'IMPORTANT', 'WARNING' and 'CAUTION' admonishment
paragraph styles are generated by placing `NOTE:`, `TIP:`,
`IMPORTANT:`, `WARNING:` or `CAUTION:` as the first word of the
paragraph. For example:

  NOTE: This is an example note.

Alternatively, you can specify the paragraph admonition style
explicitly using an <<X79,AttributeList element>>. For example:

  [NOTE]
  This is an example note.

Renders:

NOTE: This is an example note.

TIP: If your admonition requires more than a single paragraph use an
<<X22,admonition block>> instead.

[[X47]]
Admonition Icons and Captions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
NOTE: Admonition customization with `icons`, `iconsdir`, `icon` and
`caption` attributes does not apply when generating DocBook output. If
you are going the DocBook route then the <<X43,a2x(1)>> `--no-icons`
and `--icons-dir` options can be used to set the appropriate XSL
Stylesheets parameters.

By default the asciidoc(1) HTML backends generate text captions
instead of admonition icon image links. To generate links to icon
images define the <<X45,`icons`>> attribute, for example using the `-a
icons` command-line option.

The <<X44,`iconsdir`>> attribute sets the location of linked icon
images.

You can override the default icon image using the `icon` attribute to
specify the path of the linked image. For example:

  [icon="./images/icons/wink.png"]
  NOTE: What lovely war.

Use the `caption` attribute to customize the admonition captions (not
applicable to `docbook` backend). The following example suppresses the
icon image and customizes the caption of a 'NOTE' admonition
(undefining the `icons` attribute with `icons=None` is only necessary
if <<X45,admonition icons>> have been enabled):

  [icons=None, caption="My Special Note"]
  NOTE: This is my special note.

This subsection also applies to <<X22,Admonition Blocks>>.


[[X104]]
Delimited Blocks
----------------
Delimited blocks are blocks of text enveloped by leading and trailing
delimiter lines (normally a series of four or more repeated
characters). The behavior of Delimited Blocks is specified by entries
in configuration file `[blockdef-*]` sections.

Predefined Delimited Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AsciiDoc ships with a number of predefined DelimitedBlocks (see the
`asciidoc.conf` configuration file in the asciidoc(1) program
directory):

Predefined delimited block underlines:

  CommentBlock:     //////////////////////////
  PassthroughBlock: ++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  ListingBlock:     --------------------------
  LiteralBlock:     ..........................
  SidebarBlock:     **************************
  QuoteBlock:       __________________________
  ExampleBlock:     ==========================
  OpenBlock:        --

|ExampleBlock     |Yes |No  |Yes |Yes |Yes |Yes |Yes
|OpenBlock        |Yes |No  |Yes |Yes |Yes |Yes |Yes
|=====================================================

Listing Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
'ListingBlocks' are rendered verbatim in a monospaced font, they
retain line and whitespace formatting and are often distinguished by a
background or border. There is no text formatting or substitutions
within Listing blocks apart from Special Characters and Callouts.
Listing blocks are often used for computer output and file listings.

Here's an example:

[listing]
......................................
--------------------------------------
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
   printf("Hello World!\n");
   exit(0);
}
--------------------------------------
......................................

Which will be rendered like:

--------------------------------------
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello World!\n");
    exit(0);
}
--------------------------------------

By convention <<X59,filter blocks>> use the listing block syntax and
are implemented as distinct listing block styles.

[[X65]]
Literal Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
'LiteralBlocks' are rendered just like <<X85,literal paragraphs>>.
Example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
...................................
Consul *necessitatibus* per id,
consetetur, eu pro everti postulant
homero verear ea mea, qui.
...................................
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Renders:
...................................
Consul *necessitatibus* per id,
consetetur, eu pro everti postulant
homero verear ea mea, qui.
...................................

If the 'listing' style is applied to a LiteralBlock it will be
rendered as a ListingBlock (this is handy if you have a listing
containing a ListingBlock).

Sidebar Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A sidebar is a short piece of text presented outside the narrative
flow of the main text. The sidebar is normally presented inside a
bordered box to set it apart from the main text.

The sidebar body is treated like a normal section body.

Here's an example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
.An Example Sidebar
************************************************
Any AsciiDoc SectionBody element (apart from
SidebarBlocks) can be placed inside a sidebar.
************************************************
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Which will be rendered like:

.An Example Sidebar
************************************************
Any AsciiDoc SectionBody element (apart from
SidebarBlocks) can be placed inside a sidebar.
************************************************

[[X26]]
Comment Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The contents of 'CommentBlocks' are not processed; they are useful for
annotations and for excluding new or outdated content that you don't
want displayed. CommentBlocks are never written to output files.
Example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
//////////////////////////////////////////
CommentBlock contents are not processed by
asciidoc(1).
//////////////////////////////////////////
---------------------------------------------------------------------

See also <<X25,Comment Lines>>.

NOTE: System macros are executed inside comment blocks.

[[X76]]
Passthrough Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By default the block contents is subject only to 'attributes' and
'macros' substitutions (use an explicit 'subs' attribute to apply
different substitutions).  PassthroughBlock content will often be
backend specific. Here's an example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
[subs="quotes"]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<table border="1"><tr>
  <td>*Cell 1*</td>
  <td>*Cell 2*</td>
</tr></table>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The following styles can be applied to passthrough blocks:

pass::
  No substitutions are performed. This is equivalent to `subs="none"`.

asciimath, latexmath::
  By default no substitutions are performed, the contents are rendered
  as <<X78,mathematical formulas>>.

Quote Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~
'QuoteBlocks' are used for quoted passages of text. There are two
styles: 'quote' and 'verse'. The style behavior is identical to
<<X94,quote and verse paragraphs>> except that blocks can contain
multiple paragraphs and, in the case of the 'quote' style, other
section elements.  The first positional attribute sets the style, if
no attributes are specified the 'quote' style is used.  The optional
'attribution' and 'citetitle' attributes (positional attributes 2 and
3) specify the quote's author and source. For example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
[quote, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]
____________________________________________________________________
As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and
grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the
bell. Holmes whistled.

"A pair, by the sound," said he. "Yes," he continued, glancing
out of the window. "A nice little brougham and a pair of
beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There's money in
this case, Watson, if there is nothing else."

Example Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
'ExampleBlocks' encapsulate the DocBook Example element and are used
for, well, examples.  Example blocks can be titled by preceding them
with a 'BlockTitle'.  DocBook toolchains will normally automatically
number examples and generate a 'List of Examples' backmatter section.

Example blocks are delimited by lines of equals characters and can
contain any block elements apart from Titles, BlockTitles and
Sidebars) inside an example block. For example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
.An example
=====================================================================
Qui in magna commodo, est labitur dolorum an. Est ne magna primis
adolescens.
=====================================================================
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Renders:

.An example
=====================================================================
Qui in magna commodo, est labitur dolorum an. Est ne magna primis
adolescens.
=====================================================================

A title prefix that can be inserted with the `caption` attribute
(HTML backends). For example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
[caption="Example 1: "]
.An example with a custom caption
=====================================================================
Qui in magna commodo, est labitur dolorum an. Est ne magna primis
adolescens.
=====================================================================
---------------------------------------------------------------------

[[X22]]
Admonition Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The 'ExampleBlock' definition includes a set of admonition
<<X23,styles>> ('NOTE', 'TIP', 'IMPORTANT', 'WARNING', 'CAUTION') for
generating admonition blocks (admonitions containing more than a
<<X28,single paragraph>>).  Just precede the 'ExampleBlock' with an
attribute list specifying the admonition style name. For example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
[NOTE]
.A NOTE admonition block
=====================================================================
Qui in magna commodo, est labitur dolorum an. Est ne magna primis
adolescens.

. Fusce euismod commodo velit.
. Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
  .. Fusce euismod commodo velit.
  .. Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
. Donec eget arcu bibendum
  nunc consequat lobortis.
=====================================================================
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Renders:

[NOTE]
.A NOTE admonition block
=====================================================================
Qui in magna commodo, est labitur dolorum an. Est ne magna primis

. Fusce euismod commodo velit.
. Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
  .. Fusce euismod commodo velit.
  .. Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
. Donec eget arcu bibendum
  nunc consequat lobortis.
=====================================================================

See also <<X47,Admonition Icons and Captions>>.

[[X29]]
Open Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~
Open blocks are special:

- The open block delimiter is line containing two hyphen characters
  (instead of four or more repeated characters).

- They can be used to group block elements for <<X15,List item
  continuation>>.

- Open blocks can be styled to behave like any other type of delimited
  block.  The  following built-in styles can be applied to open
  blocks: 'literal', 'verse', 'quote', 'listing', 'TIP', 'NOTE',
  'IMPORTANT', 'WARNING', 'CAUTION', 'abstract', 'partintro',
  'comment', 'example', 'sidebar', 'source', 'music', 'latex',
  'graphviz'. For example, the following open block and listing block
  are functionally identical:

  [listing]
  --
  Lorum ipsum ...
  --

  ---------------
  Lorum ipsum ...
  ---------------

- An unstyled open block groups section elements but otherwise does
  nothing.

Open blocks are used to generate document abstracts and book part
introductions:

- Apply the 'abstract' style to generate an abstract, for example:

  [abstract]
  --
  In this paper we will ...
  --

. Apply the 'partintro' style to generate a book part introduction for
  a multi-part book, for example:

  [partintro]
  .Optional part introduction title
  --
  Optional part introduction goes here.

[[X64]]
Lists
-----
.List types
- Bulleted lists. Also known as itemized or unordered lists.
- Numbered lists. Also called ordered lists.
- Labeled lists. Sometimes called variable or definition lists.
- Callout lists (a list of callout annotations).

.List behavior
- List item indentation is optional and does not determine nesting,
  indentation does however make the source more readable.
- Another list or a literal paragraph immediately following a list
  item will be implicitly included in the list item; use <<X15, list
  item continuation>> to explicitly append other block elements to a
  list item.
- A comment block or a comment line block macro element will terminate
  a list -- use inline comment lines to put comments inside lists.
- The `listindex` <<X60,intrinsic attribute>> is the current list item
  index (1..). If this attribute is used outside a list then it's value
  is the number of items in the most recently closed list. Useful for
  displaying the number of items in a list.

Bulleted Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Bulleted list items start with a single dash or one to five asterisks
followed by some white space then some text. Bulleted list syntaxes
are:

...................
- List item.
* List item.
** List item.
*** List item.
**** List item.
***** List item.
...................

Numbered Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
List item numbers are explicit or implicit.

.Explicit numbering
List items begin with a number followed by some white space then the
item text. The numbers can be decimal (arabic), roman (upper or lower
case) or alpha (upper or lower case). Decimal and alpha numbers are
terminated with a period, roman numbers are terminated with a closing
parenthesis. The different terminators are necessary to ensure 'i',
'v' and 'x' roman numbers are are distinguishable from 'x', 'v' and
'x' alpha numbers. Examples:

.....................................................................
1.   Arabic (decimal) numbered list item.
a.   Lower case alpha (letter) numbered list item.
F.   Upper case alpha (letter) numbered list item.
iii) Lower case roman numbered list item.
IX)  Upper case roman numbered list item.
.....................................................................

.Implicit numbering
List items begin one to five period characters, followed by some white
space then the item text. Examples:

.....................................................................
. Arabic (decimal) numbered list item.
.. Lower case alpha (letter) numbered list item.
... Lower case roman numbered list item.
.... Upper case alpha (letter) numbered list item.
..... Upper case roman numbered list item.
.....................................................................

You can use the 'style' attribute (also the first positional
attribute) to specify an alternative numbering style.  The numbered
list style can be one of the following values: 'arabic', 'loweralpha',
'upperalpha', 'lowerroman', 'upperroman'.

Here are some examples of bulleted and numbered lists:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Praesent eget purus quis magna eleifend eleifend.
  1. Fusce euismod commodo velit.
    a. Fusce euismod commodo velit.
    b. Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
    c. Donec eget arcu bibendum nunc consequat lobortis.
  2. Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
    i)  Fusce euismod commodo velit.
    ii) Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
  3. Donec eget arcu bibendum nunc consequat lobortis.
  4. Nam fermentum mattis ante.
- Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
  * Fusce euismod commodo velit.
  ** Qui in magna commodo, est labitur dolorum an. Est ne magna primis
     adolescens. Sit munere ponderum dignissim et. Minim luptatum et
     vel.
  ** Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
  * Donec eget arcu bibendum nunc consequat lobortis.
- Nulla porttitor vulputate libero.
  . Fusce euismod commodo velit.
  . Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
[upperroman]
    .. Fusce euismod commodo velit.
    .. Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
  . Donec eget arcu bibendum nunc consequat lobortis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Which render as:

- Praesent eget purus quis magna eleifend eleifend.
  1. Fusce euismod commodo velit.
    a. Fusce euismod commodo velit.
    b. Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
    c. Donec eget arcu bibendum nunc consequat lobortis.
  2. Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
    i)  Fusce euismod commodo velit.
    ii) Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
  3. Donec eget arcu bibendum nunc consequat lobortis.
  4. Nam fermentum mattis ante.
- Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
  * Fusce euismod commodo velit.
  ** Qui in magna commodo, est labitur dolorum an. Est ne magna primis
     adolescens. Sit munere ponderum dignissim et. Minim luptatum et
     vel.
  ** Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
  * Donec eget arcu bibendum nunc consequat lobortis.
- Nulla porttitor vulputate libero.
  . Fusce euismod commodo velit.
  . Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
[upperroman]
    .. Fusce euismod commodo velit.
    .. Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
  . Donec eget arcu bibendum nunc consequat lobortis.

A predefined 'compact' option is available to bulleted and numbered
lists -- this translates to the DocBook 'spacing="compact"' lists
attribute which may or may not be processed by the DocBook toolchain.
Example:

  [options="compact"]
  - Compact list item.
  - Another compact list item.

TIP: To apply the 'compact' option globally define a document-wide
'compact-option' attribute, e.g. using the `-a compact-option`
command-line option.

You can set the list start number using the 'start' attribute (works
for HTML outputs and DocBook outputs processed by DocBook XSL
Stylesheets). Example:

  [start=7]
  . List item 7.
  . List item 8.

Labeled Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Labeled list items consist of one or more text labels followed by the
text of the list item.

An item label begins a line with an alphanumeric character hard
against the left margin and ends with two, three or four colons or two
semi-colons. A list item can have multiple labels, one per line.

The list item text consists of one or more lines of text starting
after the last label (either on the same line or a new line) and can
be followed by nested List or ListParagraph elements. Item text can be
optionally indented.

Here are some examples:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
In::
Lorem::
  Fusce euismod commodo velit.

  Fusce euismod commodo velit.

Ipsum:: Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
  * Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
  * Donec eget arcu bibendum nunc consequat lobortis.
Dolor::
  Donec eget arcu bibendum nunc consequat lobortis.
  Suspendisse;;
    A massa id sem aliquam auctor.
  Morbi;;
    Pretium nulla vel lorem.
  In;;
    Dictum mauris in urna.
    Vivamus::: Fringilla mi eu lacus.
    Donec:::   Eget arcu bibendum nunc consequat lobortis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Which render as:

In::
Lorem::
  Fusce euismod commodo velit.

  Fusce euismod commodo velit.

Ipsum:: Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
  * Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
  * Donec eget arcu bibendum nunc consequat lobortis.
Dolor::
  Donec eget arcu bibendum nunc consequat lobortis.
  Suspendisse;;
    A massa id sem aliquam auctor.
  Morbi;;
    Pretium nulla vel lorem.
  In;;
    Dictum mauris in urna.
    Vivamus::: Fringilla mi eu lacus.
    Donec:::   Eget arcu bibendum nunc consequat lobortis.

Horizontal labeled list style
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The 'horizontal' labeled list style (also the first positional
attribute) places the list text side-by-side with the label instead of
under the label. Here is an example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
[horizontal]
*Lorem*:: Fusce euismod commodo velit.  Qui in magna commodo, est
labitur dolorum an. Est ne magna primis adolescens.

  Fusce euismod commodo velit.

*Ipsum*:: Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
- Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
- Donec eget arcu bibendum nunc consequat lobortis.

*Dolor*::
  - Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
  - Donec eget arcu bibendum nunc consequat lobortis.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Which render as:

[horizontal]
*Lorem*:: Fusce euismod commodo velit.  Qui in magna commodo, est
labitur dolorum an. Est ne magna primis adolescens.

  Fusce euismod commodo velit.

*Ipsum*:: Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
- Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
- Donec eget arcu bibendum nunc consequat lobortis.

*Dolor*::
  - Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
  - Donec eget arcu bibendum nunc consequat lobortis.

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
- Current PDF toolchains do not make a good job of determining
  the relative column widths for horizontal labeled lists.
- Nested horizontal labeled lists will generate DocBook validation
  errors because the 'DocBook XML V4.2' DTD does not permit nested
  informal tables (although <<X13,DocBook XSL Stylesheets>> and
  <<X31,dblatex>> process them correctly).
- The label width can be set as a percentage of the total width by
  setting the 'width' attribute e.g. `width="10%"`
=====================================================================

Question and Answer Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AsciiDoc comes pre-configured with a 'qanda' style labeled list for generating
DocBook question and answer (Q&A) lists. Example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
[qanda]
Question one::
        Answer one.
Question two::
        Answer two.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Renders:

[qanda]
Question one::
        Answer one.
Question two::
        Answer two.

Glossary Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AsciiDoc comes pre-configured with a 'glossary' style labeled list for
generating DocBook glossary lists. Example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
[glossary]
A glossary term::
    The corresponding definition.
A second glossary term::
    The corresponding definition.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

For working examples see the `article.txt` and `book.txt` documents in
the AsciiDoc `./doc` distribution directory.

NOTE: To generate valid DocBook output glossary lists must be located
in a section that uses the 'glossary' <<X93,section markup template>>.

Bibliography Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AsciiDoc comes with a predefined 'bibliography' bulleted list style
generating DocBook bibliography entries. Example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
[bibliography]
.Optional list title
- [[[taoup]]] Eric Steven Raymond. 'The Art of UNIX
  Programming'. Addison-Wesley. ISBN 0-13-142901-9.
- [[[walsh-muellner]]] Norman Walsh & Leonard Muellner.
  'DocBook - The Definitive Guide'. O'Reilly & Associates. 1999. 
  ISBN 1-56592-580-7.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The `[[[<reference>]]]` syntax is a bibliography entry anchor, it
generates an anchor named `<reference>` and additionally displays
`[<reference>]` at the anchor position. For example `[[[taoup]]]`
generates an anchor named `taoup` that displays `[taoup]` at the
anchor position. Cite the reference from elsewhere your document using
`<<taoup>>`, this displays a hyperlink (`[taoup]`) to the
corresponding bibliography entry anchor.

For working examples see the `article.txt` and `book.txt` documents in
the AsciiDoc `./doc` distribution directory.

NOTE: To generate valid DocBook output bibliography lists must be
located in a <<X93,bibliography section>>.

[[X15]]
List Item Continuation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Another list or a literal paragraph immediately following a list item
is implicitly appended to the list item; to append other block
elements to a list item you need to explicitly join them to the list
item with a 'list continuation' (a separator line containing a single
plus character). Multiple block elements can be appended to a list
item using list continuations (provided they are legal list item
children in the backend markup).

Here are some examples of list item continuations: list item one
contains multiple continuations; list item two is continued with an
<<X29,OpenBlock>> containing multiple elements:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. List item one.
+
List item one continued with a second paragraph followed by an
Indented block.
+
.................
$ ls *.sh
$ mv *.sh ~/tmp
.................
+
List item continued with a third paragraph.

2. List item two continued with an open block.
+
--
This paragraph is part of the preceding list item.

a. This list is nested and does not require explicit item continuation.
+
This paragraph is part of the preceding list item.

b. List item b.

This paragraph belongs to item two of the outer list.
--
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Renders:

1. List item one.
+
List item one continued with a second paragraph followed by an
Indented block.
+
.................
$ ls *.sh
$ mv *.sh ~/tmp
.................
+
List item continued with a third paragraph.

2. List item two continued with an open block.
+
--
This paragraph is part of the preceding list item.

a. This list is nested and does not require explicit item continuation.
+
This paragraph is part of the preceding list item.

b. List item b.

This paragraph belongs to item two of the outer list.

[[X92]]
Footnotes
---------
The shipped AsciiDoc configuration includes three footnote inline
macros:

`footnote:[<text>]`::
  Generates a footnote with text `<text>`.

`footnoteref:[<id>,<text>]`::
  Generates a footnote with a reference ID `<id>` and text `<text>`.

`footnoteref:[<id>]`::
  Generates a reference to the footnote with ID `<id>`.

The footnote text can span multiple lines.

The 'xhtml11' and 'html5' backends render footnotes dynamically using
JavaScript; 'html4' outputs do not use JavaScript and leave the
footnotes inline; 'docbook' footnotes are processed by the downstream
DocBook toolchain.

Example footnotes:

  A footnote footnote:[An example footnote.];
  a second footnote with a reference ID footnoteref:[note2,Second footnote.];
  finally a reference to the second footnote footnoteref:[note2].

Renders:

A footnote footnote:[An example footnote.];
a second footnote with a reference ID footnoteref:[note2,Second footnote.];
finally a reference to the second footnote footnoteref:[note2].


Indexes
-------
The shipped AsciiDoc configuration includes the inline macros for
generating DocBook index entries.

`indexterm:[<primary>,<secondary>,<tertiary>]`::
`(((<primary>,<secondary>,<tertiary>)))`::
    This inline macro generates an index term (the `<secondary>` and
    `<tertiary>` positional attributes are optional). Example:
    `indexterm:[Tigers,Big cats]` (or, using the alternative syntax
    `(((Tigers,Big cats)))`.  Index terms that have secondary and
    tertiary entries also generate separate index terms for the
    secondary and tertiary entries. The index terms appear in the
    index, not the primary text flow.

`indexterm2:[<primary>]`::
`((<primary>))`::
    This inline macro generates an index term that appears in both the
    index and the primary text flow.  The `<primary>` should not be
    padded to the left or right with white space characters.

For working examples see the `article.txt` and `book.txt` documents in
the AsciiDoc `./doc` distribution directory.

NOTE: Index entries only really make sense if you are generating
DocBook markup -- DocBook conversion programs automatically generate
an index at the point an 'Index' section appears in source document.


[[X105]]
Callouts
--------
Callouts are a mechanism for annotating verbatim text (for example:
source code, computer output and user input). Callout markers are
placed inside the annotated text while the actual annotations are
presented in a callout list after the annotated text. Here's an
example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------

.Explanation
- The callout marks are whole numbers enclosed in angle brackets --
  they refer to the correspondingly numbered item in the following
  callout list.
- By default callout marks are confined to 'LiteralParagraphs',
  'LiteralBlocks' and 'ListingBlocks' (although this is a
  configuration file option and can be changed).
- Callout list item numbering is fairly relaxed -- list items can
  start with `<n>`, `n>` or `>` where `n` is the optional list item
  number (in the latter case list items starting with a single `>`
  character are implicitly numbered starting at one).
- Callout lists should not be nested.
- Callout lists cannot be used within tables.
- Callout lists start list items hard against the left margin.
- If you want to present a number inside angle brackets you'll need to
  escape it with a backslash to prevent it being interpreted as a
  callout mark.

NOTE: Define the AsciiDoc 'icons' attribute (for example using the `-a
icons` command-line option) to display callout icons.

Implementation Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Callout marks are generated by the 'callout' inline macro while
callout lists are generated using the 'callout' list definition. The
'callout' macro and 'callout' list are special in that they work
together. The 'callout' inline macro is not enabled by the normal
'macros' substitutions option, instead it has its own 'callouts'
substitution option.

The following attributes are available during inline callout macro
substitution:

`{index}`::
    The callout list item index inside the angle brackets.
`{coid}`::
    An identifier formatted like `CO<listnumber>-<index>` that
    uniquely identifies the callout mark. For example `CO2-4`
    identifies the fourth callout mark in the second set of callout
    marks.

The `{coids}` attribute can be used during callout list item
substitution -- it is a space delimited list of callout IDs that refer
to the explanatory list item.

Including callouts in included code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can annotate working code examples with callouts -- just remember
to put the callouts inside source code comments. This example displays
the `test.py` source file (containing a single callout) using the
'source' (code highlighter) filter:

.AsciiDoc source
---------------------------------------------------------------------
 [source,python]
 -------------------------------------------
 \include::test.py[]
 -------------------------------------------

 \<1> Print statement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

.Included `test.py` source
---------------------------------------------------------------------
print 'Hello World!'   # \<1>
---------------------------------------------------------------------


Macros
------
Macros are a mechanism for substituting parametrized text into output
documents.

Macros have a 'name', a single 'target' argument and an 'attribute
list'.  The usual syntax is `<name>:<target>[<attrlist>]` (for
inline macros) and `<name>::<target>[<attrlist>]` (for block
macros).  Here are some examples:

  http://www.docbook.org/[DocBook.org]
  include::chapt1.txt[tabsize=2]
  mailto:srackham@gmail.com[]

.Macro behavior
- `<name>` is the macro name. It can only contain letters, digits or
  dash characters and cannot start with a dash.
- The optional `<target>` cannot contain white space characters.
- `<attrlist>` is a <<X21,list of attributes>> enclosed in square
  brackets.
- `]` characters inside attribute lists must be escaped with a
  backslash.
- Expansion of macro references can normally be escaped by prefixing a
  backslash character (see the AsciiDoc 'FAQ' for examples of
  exceptions to this rule).
- Attribute references in block macros are expanded.
- The substitutions performed prior to Inline macro macro expansion
  are determined by the inline context.
- Macros are processed in the order they appear in the configuration
  file(s).
- Calls to inline macros can be nested inside different inline macros
  (an inline macro call cannot contain a nested call to itself).
- In addition to `<name>`, `<target>` and `<attrlist>` the
  `<passtext>` and `<subslist>` named groups are available to
  <<X77,passthrough macros>>. A macro is a passthrough macro if the
  definition includes a `<passtext>` named group.

Inline Macros
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Inline Macros occur in an inline element context. Predefined Inline
macros include 'URLs', 'image' and 'link' macros.

URLs
^^^^
'http', 'https', 'ftp', 'file', 'mailto' and 'callto' URLs are
rendered using predefined inline macros.

- If you don't need a custom link caption you can enter the 'http',
  'https', 'ftp', 'file' URLs and email addresses without any special
  macro syntax.
- If the `<attrlist>` is empty the URL is displayed.

Here are some examples:

  http://www.docbook.org/[DocBook.org]
  http://www.docbook.org/
  mailto:joe.bloggs@foobar.com[email Joe Bloggs]
  joe.bloggs@foobar.com

Which are rendered:

http://www.docbook.org/[DocBook.org]

http://www.docbook.org/

mailto:joe.bloggs@foobar.com[email Joe Bloggs]

joe.bloggs@foobar.com

If the `<target>` necessitates space characters use `%20`, for example
`large%20image.png`.

Internal Cross References
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Two AsciiDoc inline macros are provided for creating hypertext links
within an AsciiDoc document. You can use either the standard macro
syntax or the (preferred) alternative.

[[X30]]
anchor
++++++
Used to specify hypertext link targets:

  [[<id>,<xreflabel>]]
  anchor:<id>[<xreflabel>]

The `<id>` is a unique string that conforms to the output markup's
anchor syntax. The optional `<xreflabel>` is the text to be displayed
by captionless 'xref' macros that refer to this anchor. The optional
`<xreflabel>` is only really useful when generating DocBook output.
Example anchor:

  [[X1]]

You may have noticed that the syntax of this inline element is the
same as that of the <<X41,BlockId block element>>, this is no
coincidence since they are functionally equivalent.

xref
++++
Creates a hypertext link to a document anchor.

  <<<id>,<caption>>>
  xref:<id>[<caption>]

The `<id>` refers to an anchor ID. The optional `<caption>` is the
link's displayed text. Example:

  <<X21,attribute lists>>

If `<caption>` is not specified then the displayed text is
auto-generated:

- The AsciiDoc 'xhtml11' and 'html5' backends display the `<id>`
  enclosed in square brackets.
- If DocBook is produced the DocBook toolchain is responsible for the
  displayed text which will normally be the referenced figure, table
  or section title number followed by the element's title text.

Here is an example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
[[tiger_image]]
.Tyger tyger
image::tiger.png[]

This can be seen in <<tiger_image>>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Linking to Local Documents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Hypertext links to files on the local file system are specified using
the 'link' inline macro.

  link:<target>[<caption>]

The 'link' macro generates relative URLs. The link macro `<target>` is
the target file name (relative to the file system location of the
referring document). The optional `<caption>` is the link's displayed
text. If `<caption>` is not specified then `<target>` is displayed.
Example:

  link:downloads/foo.zip[download foo.zip]

You can use the `<filename>#<id>` syntax to refer to an anchor within
a target document but this usually only makes sense when targeting
HTML documents.

[[X9]]
Images
^^^^^^
Inline images are inserted into the output document using the 'image'
macro. The inline syntax is:

  image:<target>[<attributes>]

The contents of the image file `<target>` is displayed. To display the
image its file format must be supported by the target backend
application. HTML and DocBook applications normally support PNG or JPG
files.

`<target>` file name paths are relative to the location of the
referring document.

[[X55]]
.Image macro attributes
- The optional 'alt' attribute is also the first positional attribute,
  it specifies alternative text which is displayed if the output
  application is unable to display the image file (see also
  http://htmlhelp.com/feature/art3.htm[Use of ALT texts in IMGs]). For
  example:

  image:images/logo.png[Company Logo]

- The optional 'title' attribute provides a title for the image. The
  <<X49,block image macro>> renders the title alongside the image.
  The inline image macro displays the title as a popup ``tooltip'' in
  visual browsers (AsciiDoc HTML outputs only).

- The optional `width` and `height` attributes scale the image size
  and can be used in any combination. The units are pixels.  The
  following example scales the previous example to a height of 32
  pixels:

  image:images/logo.png["Company Logo",height=32]

- The optional `link` attribute is used to link the image to an
  external document. The following example links a screenshot
  thumbnail to a full size version:

  image:screen-thumbnail.png[height=32,link="screen.png"]

- The optional `scaledwidth` attribute is only used in DocBook block
  images (specifically for PDF documents). The following example
  scales the images to 75% of the available print width:

  image::images/logo.png[scaledwidth="75%",alt="Company Logo"]

- The image `scale` attribute sets the DocBook `imagedata` element
  `scale` attribute.

- The optional `align` attribute aligns block macro images
  horizontally.  Allowed values are `center`, `left` and `right`. For
  example:

  image::images/tiger.png["Tiger image",align="left"]

- The optional `float` attribute floats the image `left` or `right` on
  the page (works with HTML outputs only, has no effect on DocBook
  outputs). `float` and `align` attributes are mutually exclusive.
  Use the `unfloat::[]` block macro to stop floating.

Comment Lines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
See <<X25,comment block macro>>.

Block Macros
~~~~~~~~~~~~
A Block macro reference must be contained in a single line separated
either side by a blank line or a block delimiter.

Block macros behave just like Inline macros, with the following
differences:

- They occur in a block context.
- The default syntax is `<name>::<target>[<attrlist>]` (two
  colons, not one).
- Markup template section names end in `-blockmacro` instead of
  `-inlinemacro`.

Block Identifier
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Block Identifier macro sets the `id` attribute and has the same
syntax as the <<X30,anchor inline macro>> since it performs
essentially the same function -- block templates use the `id`
attribute as a block element ID. For example:

  [[X30]]

This is equivalent to the `[id="X30"]` <<X79,AttributeList element>>).

[[X49]]
Images
^^^^^^
The 'image' block macro is used to display images in a block context.
The syntax is:

  image::<target>[<attributes>]

The block `image` macro has the same <<X55,macro attributes>> as it's
<<X9,inline image macro>> counterpart.

WARNING: Unlike the inline `image` macro, the entire block `image` macro
must be on a single line.

Block images can be titled by preceding the 'image' macro with a
'BlockTitle'.  DocBook toolchains normally number titled block images
and optionally list them in an automatically generated 'List of
Figures' backmatter section.

This example:

  .Main circuit board
  image::images/layout.png[J14P main circuit board]

is equivalent to:

  image::images/layout.png["J14P main circuit board", title="Main circuit board"]

A title prefix that can be inserted with the `caption` attribute
(HTML backends). For example:

  .Main circuit board
  [caption="Figure 2: "]
  image::images/layout.png[J14P main circuit board]

[[X66]]
.Embedding images in XHTML documents
*********************************************************************
If you define the `data-uri` attribute then images will be embedded in
XHTML outputs using the
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data:_URI_scheme[data URI scheme].  You
can use the 'data-uri' attribute with the 'xhtml11' and 'html5'
backends to produce single-file XHTML documents with embedded images
and CSS, for example:

  $ asciidoc -a data-uri mydocument.txt

[NOTE]
======
- All current popular browsers support data URIs, although versions
  of Internet Explorer prior to version 8 do not.
- Some browsers limit the size of data URIs.
======
*********************************************************************

[[X25]]
Comment Lines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Single lines starting with two forward slashes hard up against the
left margin are treated as comments. Comment lines do not appear in
the output unless the 'showcomments' attribute is defined.  Comment
lines have been implemented as both block and inline macros so a
comment line can appear as a stand-alone block or within block elements
that support inline macro expansion. Example comment line:

  // This is a comment.

If the 'showcomments' attribute is defined comment lines are written
to the output:

- In DocBook the comment lines are enclosed by the 'remark' element
  (which may or may not be rendered by your toolchain).
- The 'showcomments' attribute does not expose <<X26,Comment Blocks>>.
  Comment Blocks are never passed to the output.

System Macros
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
System macros are block macros that perform a predefined task and are
hardwired into the asciidoc(1) program.

- You can escape system macros with a leading backslash character
  (as you can with other macros).
- The syntax and tasks performed by system macros is built into
  asciidoc(1) so they don't appear in configuration files.  You can
  however customize the syntax by adding entries to a configuration
  file `[macros]` section.

[[X63]]
Include Macros
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The `include` and `include1`  system macros to include the contents of
a named file into the source document.

The `include` macro includes a file as if it were part of the parent
document -- tabs are expanded and system macros processed. The
contents of `include1` files are not subject to tab expansion or
system macro processing nor are attribute or lower priority
substitutions performed. The `include1` macro's intended use is to
include verbatim embedded CSS or scripts into configuration file
headers.  Example:

------------------------------------
\include::chapter1.txt[tabsize=4]
------------------------------------

.Include macro behavior
- If the included file name is specified with a relative path then the
  path is relative to the location of the referring document.
- Include macros can appear inside configuration files.
- Files included from within 'DelimitedBlocks' are read to completion
  to avoid false end-of-block underline termination.
- Attribute references are expanded inside the include 'target'; if an
  attribute is undefined then the included file is silently skipped.
- The 'tabsize' macro attribute sets the number of space characters to
  be used for tab expansion in the included file (not applicable to
  `include1` macro).
- The 'depth' macro attribute sets the maximum permitted number of
  subsequent nested includes (not applicable to `include1` macro which
  does not process nested includes). Setting 'depth' to '1' disables
  nesting inside the included file. By default, nesting is limited to
  a depth of ten.
- If the he 'warnings' attribute is set to 'False' (or any other
  Python literal that evaluates to boolean false) then no warning
  message is printed if the included file does not exist. By default
  'warnings' are enabled.
- Internally the `include1` macro is translated to the `include1`
  system attribute which means it must be evaluated in a region where
  attribute substitution is enabled. To inhibit nested substitution in
  included files it is preferable to use the `include` macro and set
  the attribute `depth=1`.

Conditional Inclusion Macros
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Lines of text in the source document can be selectively included or
excluded from processing based on the existence (or not) of a document
attribute.

Document text between the `ifdef` and `endif` macros is included if a
document attribute is defined:

  ifdef::<attribute>[]
  :
  endif::<attribute>[]

Document text between the `ifndef` and `endif` macros is not included
if a document attribute is defined:

  ifndef::<attribute>[]
  :
  endif::<attribute>[]

`<attribute>` is an attribute name which is optional in the trailing
`endif` macro.

If you only want to process a single line of text then the text can be
put inside the square brackets and the `endif` macro omitted, for
example:

  ifdef::revnumber[Version number 42]

Is equivalent to:

  ifdef::revnumber[]
  Version number 42
  endif::revnumber[]

'ifdef' and 'ifndef' macros also accept multiple attribute names:

- Multiple ',' separated attribute names evaluate to defined if one
  or more of the attributes is defined, otherwise it's value is
  undefined.
- Multiple '+' separated attribute names evaluate to defined if all
  of the attributes is defined, otherwise it's value is undefined.

Document text between the `ifeval` and `endif` macros is included if
the Python expression inside the square brackets is true. Example:

  ifeval::[{rs458}==2]
  :
  endif::[]

- Document attribute references are expanded before the expression is
  evaluated.
- If an attribute reference is undefined then the expression is
  considered false.

Take a look at the `*.conf` configuration files in the AsciiDoc
distribution for examples of conditional inclusion macro usage.

Executable system macros
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The 'eval', 'sys' and 'sys2' block macros exhibit the same behavior as
their same named <<X24, system attribute references>>. The difference
is that system macros occur in a block macro context whereas system
attributes are confined to inline contexts where attribute
substitution is enabled.

The following example displays a long directory listing inside a
literal block:

  ------------------
  sys::[ls -l *.txt]
  ------------------

NOTE: There are no block macro versions of the 'eval3' and 'sys3'
system attributes.

Template System Macro
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The `template` block macro allows the inclusion of one configuration
file template section within another.  The following example includes
the `[admonitionblock]` section in the `[admonitionparagraph]`
section:

  [admonitionparagraph]
  template::[admonitionblock]

.Template macro behavior
- The `template::[]` macro is useful for factoring configuration file
  markup.
- `template::[]` macros cannot be nested.
- `template::[]` macro expansion is applied after all configuration
  files have been read.


[[X77]]
Passthrough macros
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Passthrough macros are analogous to <<X76,passthrough blocks>> and are
used to pass text directly to the output. The substitution performed
on the text is determined by the macro definition but can be overridden
by the `<subslist>`.  The usual syntax is
`<name>:<subslist>[<passtext>]` (for inline macros) and
`<name>::<subslist>[<passtext>]` (for block macros). Passthroughs, by
definition, take precedence over all other text substitutions.

pass::
  Inline and block. Passes text unmodified (apart from explicitly
  specified substitutions). Examples:

  pass:[<q>To be or not to be</q>]
  pass:attributes,quotes[<u>the '{author}'</u>]

asciimath, latexmath::
  Inline and block. Passes text unmodified.  Used for
  <<X78,mathematical formulas>>.

\+++::
  Inline and block. The triple-plus passthrough is functionally
  identical to the 'pass' macro but you don't have to escape `]`
  characters and you can prefix with quoted attributes in the inline
  version. Example:

  Red [red]+++`sum_(i=1)\^n i=(n(n+1))/2`$+++ AsciiMathML formula

$$::
  Inline and block. The double-dollar passthrough is functionally
  identical to the triple-plus passthrough with one exception: special
  characters are escaped. Example:

  $$`[[a,b],[c,d]]((n),(k))`$$

[[X80]]`::
  Text quoted with single backtick characters constitutes an 'inline
  literal' passthrough. The enclosed text is rendered in a monospaced
  font and is only subject to special character substitution.  This
  makes sense since monospace text is usually intended to be rendered
  literally and often contains characters that would otherwise have to
  be escaped. If you need monospaced text containing inline
  substitutions use a <<X81,plus character instead of a backtick>>.

Macro Definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Each entry in the configuration `[macros]` section is a macro
definition which can take one of the following forms:

`<pattern>=<name>[<subslist]`:: Inline macro definition.
`<pattern>=#<name>[<subslist]`:: Block macro definition.
`<pattern>=+<name>[<subslist]`:: System macro definition.
`<pattern>`:: Delete the existing macro with this `<pattern>`.

`<pattern>` is a Python regular expression and `<name>` is the name of
a markup template. If `<name>` is omitted then it is the value of the
regular expression match group named 'name'.  The optional
`[<subslist]` is a comma-separated list of substitution names enclosed
in `[]` brackets, it sets the default substitutions for passthrough
text, if omitted then no passthrough substitutions are performed.

.Pattern named groups
The following named groups can be used in macro `<pattern>` regular
expressions and are available as markup template attributes:

name::
  The macro name.

target::
  The macro target.

attrlist::
  The macro attribute list.

passtext::
  Contents of this group are passed unmodified to the output subject
  only to 'subslist' substitutions.

subslist::
  Processed as a comma-separated list of substitution names for
  'passtext' substitution, overrides the the macro definition
  'subslist'.

.Here's what happens during macro substitution
- Each contextually relevant macro 'pattern' from the `[macros]`
  section is matched against the input source line.
- If a match is found the text to be substituted is loaded from a
  configuration markup template section named like
  `<name>-inlinemacro` or `<name>-blockmacro` (depending on the macro
  type).
- Global and macro attribute list attributes are substituted in the
  macro's markup template.
- The substituted template replaces the macro reference in the output
  document.


[[X98]]
HTML 5 audio and video block macros
-----------------------------------
The 'html5' backend 'audio' and 'video' block macros generate the HTML
5 'audio' and 'video' elements respectively.  They follow the usual
AsciiDoc block macro syntax `<name>::<target>[<attrlist>]` where:

[horizontal]
`<name>`:: 'audio' or 'video'.
`<target>`:: The URL or file name of the video or audio file.
`<attrlist>`:: A list of named attributes (see below).

.Audio macro attributes
[options="header",cols="1,5",frame="topbot"]
|====================================================================
|Name | Value
|options
|A comma separated list of one or more of the following items:
'autoplay', 'loop' which correspond to the same-named HTML 5 'audio'
element boolean attributes.  By default the player 'controls' are
enabled, include the 'nocontrols' option value to hide them.
|====================================================================

.Video macro attributes
[options="header",cols="1,5",frame="topbot"]
|====================================================================
|Name   | Value
|height | The height of the player in pixels.
|width  | The width of the player in pixels.
|poster | The URL or file name of an image representing the video.
|options
|A comma separated list of one or more of the following items:
'autoplay', 'loop' and 'nocontrols'. The 'autoplay' and 'loop' options
correspond to the same-named HTML 5 'video' element boolean
attributes.  By default the player 'controls' are enabled, include the
'nocontrols' option value to hide them.
|====================================================================

Examples:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
audio::images/example.ogg[]

video::gizmo.ogv[width=200,options="nocontrols,autoplay"]

.Example video
video::gizmo.ogv[]

video::http://www.808.dk/pics/video/gizmo.ogv[]
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If your needs are more complex put raw HTML 5 in a markup block, for
example (from http://www.808.dk/?code-html-5-video):

---------------------------------------------------------------------
++++
<video poster="pics/video/gizmo.jpg" id="video" style="cursor: pointer;" >
  <source src="pics/video/gizmo.mp4" />
  <source src="pics/video/gizmo.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <source src="pics/video/gizmo.ogv" type="video/ogg" />
  Video not playing? <a href="pics/video/gizmo.mp4">Download file</a> instead.
</video>

<script type="text/javascript">
  var video = document.getElementById('video');
  video.addEventListener('click',function(){
    video.play();
  },false);
</script>
++++
---------------------------------------------------------------------


Tables
------
The AsciiDoc table syntax looks and behaves like other delimited block
types and supports standard <<X73,block configuration entries>>.
Formatting is easy to read and, just as importantly, easy to enter.

- Cells and columns can be formatted using built-in customizable styles.
- Horizontal and vertical cell alignment can be set on columns and
  cell.
- Horizontal and vertical cell spanning is supported.

.Use tables sparingly
*********************************************************************
When technical users first start creating documents, tables (complete
with column spanning and table nesting) are often considered very
important. The reality is that tables are seldom used, even in
technical documentation.

Try this exercise: thumb through your library of technical books,
you'll be surprised just how seldom tables are actually used, even
less seldom are tables containing block elements (such as paragraphs
or lists) or spanned cells. This is no accident, like figures, tables
are outside the normal document flow -- tables are for consulting not
for reading.

Tables are designed for, and should normally only be used for,
displaying column oriented tabular data.

Table input data formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AsciiDoc table data can be 'psv', 'dsv' or 'csv' formatted.  The
default table format is 'psv'.

AsciiDoc 'psv' ('Prefix Separated Values') and 'dsv' ('Delimiter
Separated Values') formats are cell oriented -- the table is treated
as a sequence of cells -- there are no explicit row separators.
